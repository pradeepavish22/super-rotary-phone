**Data science** is an [interdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinary "Interdisciplinary") academic field[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-1) that uses [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [scientific computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_computing "Scientific computing"), [scientific methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method"), processes, [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") and systems to extract or extrapolate [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") and insights from potentially noisy, structured, or [unstructured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data "Unstructured data").

Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-3) Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.^[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-4)^

Data science is a "concept to unify [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis "Data analysis"), [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics "Informatics"), and their related [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method")" to "understand and analyze actual [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomena "Phenomena")" with [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data").^[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-5)^ It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), statistics, [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science "Information science"), and [domain knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge "Domain knowledge").^[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-:2-6)^ However, data science is different from [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") and information science. [Turing Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award "Turing Award") winner [Jim Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gray_(computer_scientist)) "Jim Gray (computer scientist)") imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science ([empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research "Empirical research"), [theoretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_research "Basic research"), [computational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science "Computational science"), and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "Information technology")" and the [data deluge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion "Information explosion"). ^[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-TansleyTolle2009-7)^ ^[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#cite_note-BellHey2009-8)^
